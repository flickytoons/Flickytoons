                <p>Oggy and the Cockroaches (French: Oggy et les Cafards) is a French animated comedy television series created by Jean-Yves Raimbaud for Gaumont Multimedia and Xilam Animation. The series chronicles the exploits and adventures of Oggy, a blue cat whose life is constantly interrupted by three cockroaches – Dee Dee, Marky, and Joey respectively – who love to cause mischief within his home. The show employs silent comedy: characters either do not speak or use unintelligible vocalizations and gestures. The show premiered in September 1998 on France 3, and later expanded internationally. The series ended in January 2019, having released seven seasons in over two decades.<br> In September 2020, a reboot series was announced, entitled Oggy and the Cockroaches: Next Generation, in which Oggy takes care of Piya, a young elephant from India.[3][4] It was released worldwide on Netflix on July 28, 2022. Although it differs noticeably from the original in terms of its visuals and tone, Gulli labels it as Oggy's eighth season.<br> Oggy, an anthropomorphic cat, would prefer to spend his days watching television and eating but is continually pestered by three roaches: Joey, Marky, and Dee Dee. The cockroaches' slapstick mischief ranges from plundering Oggy's refrigerator to hijacking the train he just boarded. In many situations, Oggy is also helped by Jack, who is more violent and short-tempered than him and is also annoyed by the cockroaches. Bob, a short-tempered bulldog, also appears in the show and is Oggy's neighbor.</p>
